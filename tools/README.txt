    LgEval: the Label Graph Evaluation library (by R. Zanibbi and H. Mouchere). The library uses labeled directed graphs to represent results for structural pattern recognition tasks. To obtain the current version, issue the following command using git:

        git clone http://saskatoon.cs.rit.edu:10001/root/lgeval.git 

    CROHMELib translation and file viewing utilities for CROHME InkML/MathML files (by R. Zanibbi and H. Mouchere). To obtain the current version, issue the following command using git:

        git clone http://saskatoon.cs.rit.edu:10001/root/crohmelib.git 
		
	To update these libraries, just use the following command using git: 
		
		git pull
		

    convert2symLG :
